### Develop on your local

Before you start, you should install the following software:

- Node.js

- Visual Studio Code

- Docker

- Docker Compose

Then execute as the following in your terminal:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:mugifly/angular-nest-on-docker.git
$ cd angular-nest-on-docker/

$ npm install

$ sudo docker-compose up -d
$ sudo docker-compose up --build app
```

After that, open the web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Also, when you edit the frontend source-code, HMR applies it to your browser immediately.
